    <h2>Creation & Development</h2 >
    <p id="description">
        Batman, created in 1939 by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, first appeared in Detective Comics #27. Finger shaped Batman's dark design, Gotham City, and iconic villains. Inspired by Zorro, The Shadow, and da Vinci's sketches, Batman originally killed criminals before adopting his no-kill code. Unlike Superman, he relied on intellect, detective skills, gadgets, and fear, becoming a lasting cultural icon.
