//when "this" used in normal function - it is called by the parent dirctly (points to the propery of the parent)
//when "this" used in "arrow =>" function - it refers "this" from the scope of the parent ( mostly window due to global scope

    name : "Nishit",

        console.log(this); //arrow function - value of this here is scope of parent (student object = window)
